# these can be used for like if an mc plugin or something adds a command or something
# these can be loaded by like using `import(example_module.mclangmodule)`
# this is kinda a horrible system but I'm not spending all week on it.
# this module adds the scale command from pekkui, as an example
# oh, also, the description attribute thing is for if I ever want to make an editor, so I can use that as a hover over thing.
# you can also do a \n in your script thing to make it have multiple commands, like "script":"scale ;scale; ;target;\nsummon zombie ~ ~ ~"
